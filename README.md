# MovieDecider

MovieDecider is a web application for deciding the movie you will watch for the evening.

This is an ongoing project used to practice my javascript. 

## Installation 

Currently, the only way to use this application cloning the repo and using a local server. 

## Usage

Clicking Spin the Wheel will randomly select a movie from your watchlist that you have not seen yet. After it has selected it's a movie, clicking "Let's Watch It" will set it's watched status to Watched. Spinning the Wheel again will leave it's watch status to Unwatched select a new movie. You must add movies to your watchlist before Spinning the Wheel.

Add movies to your watchlist using the Add Movie bar and selecting it's watched status (whether or not you've seen the movie you are entering). Adding a movie adds it to your local storage. 

To edit movies in your watchlist, click the View button next to the movie's title.
